### Effective-budget-planner APP

Our app is a simple budget application built with Django. It's designed to manage your personal finances. You can add your expenses, income and even manage your more important receipts. We used Django 3.2.3 version and Python 3.8.


### GETTING STARTED

The first thing to do is clone the repository:
`https://github.com/grupa2Admin/Effective-budget-planner.git`

`virtualenv --no-site-packages env`
`source env/bin/activate`

Then install the dependencies:
